# Spyderco Manix 2
The manix is one of the easiest scales to make. It is basically a flat
scale with no milling on the inside. The scale is 2.6 mm thick, with
a very slight bevel on the edge. It is held together by two screws
and the pivot, and has a reversible clip.

The lanyard is 7.6mm. The pivot looks to be about 3.65mm.
The front and mid screws are about 3.0mm.

The stock for this scale must be at least 1.5". It's a tight 
fit on that size. But that's what size I typically get mine in
so I made it work.

## Setup

This is a one-sided scale. I prep this with blue painters
tape on one side, then use a spray adhesive to secure it 
to some waste board of the same size as the scale.

Because this scale barely fits in 1.5", it needs to be lined
up exactly. Put a bit in and lower it below the stock near the
bottom left edge. Position the stock so it touches the bit and 
lightly secure the left edge. Then move the bit to the 
bottom right. Push the right edge down until it is touching the
bit and lightly secure. Go back and forth a few times to make
sure that the piece is closely alined with your X axis.

Now raise the bit to about the level of the piece. Position it
so that its center is on the lower edge. It should be about a
centimeter right of your left clamp. This will be the home
position for all of the passes.

## First Pass (optional - set depth)

If your stock is thicker than 2.6mm, you can do an initial pass to 
get it down to size. I use a 6mm compression bit. The first pass 
is a pocket of the entire scale shape to get it to the desired 
depth.

Next, we will cut out the part. This should start at
whatever depth you used for the pocket. The edge chamfer
should be 1.0 with the 90 degree bit.

Here, I'm sticking with the 6mm compression, followed by the
90 degree bit for the bevel.

## Second pass (holes)

Uses a 2mm mill for the holes. Then a 90 degree for the chamfers.
For pivot screw chamfer depth of 1.6mm. For the other two
I used a depth of 1.2.

## Third pass (cut out scale)
Edge chamfer. Will also try this at 90 degrees. It is really light, so will 
begin with .5mm.
