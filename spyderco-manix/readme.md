The manix is one of the easiest scales to make. It is basically a flat
scale with no milling on the inside. The scale is 2.6 mm thick, with
a very slight bevel on the edge. It is held together by two screws
and the pivot, and has a reversible clip.

The lanyard is 7.6mm. The pivot looks to be about 3.65mm.
The front and mid screws are about 3.0mm.
