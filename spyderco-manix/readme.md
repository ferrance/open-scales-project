# Spyderco Manix 2

![spyderco manix 2](images/manix-in-progress.jpg)

The manix is one of the easiest scales to make. It is basically a flat
scale with no milling on the inside. The scale is 2.6 mm thick, with
a very slight bevel on the edge. The knife is held together by two screws
and the pivot, and has a reversible clip.

The stock for this scale must be at least 1.5". It's a tight 
fit on that size. But that's what size I typically get mine in
so I made it work.

## Setup

This is a one-sided scale. I prep this with blue painters
tape on one side, then use superglue to secure it 
to some waste board of the same size as the scale.

Because this scale barely fits in 1.5", it needs to be lined
up exactly. Put a bit in and lower it below the stock near the
bottom left edge. Position the stock so it touches the bit and 
lightly secure the left edge. Then move the bit to the 
bottom right. Push the right edge down until it is touching the
bit and lightly secure. Go back and forth a few times to make
sure that the piece is closely alined with your X axis.

At this point I use the planer at 2.6mm, 140x42 to get the 
material to the correct height.

Now raise the bit to about the level of the piece. Position it
so that its center is on the lower edge. It should be about a
centimeter right of your left clamp. This will be the home
position for all of the passes.

## One pass method

If you have a piece of stock that is the correct thickness, this
scale is very easy to cut, requiring only one tool change.

I use a 2mm endmill for everything other than the chamfers. 
Basically I just have that tool cut all the holes and the part.
The rest is done with a 6mm, 90 degree chamfer bit. The 
pivot is chamfered to 1.7mm. The other two chamfered screw
holes go to 1.3mm. The part is chamfered to 1mm. And I 
like to chamfer the lock mechanism to .5mm.
That's it!

## Misc notes

Pivot hole appears to be 1/8".
The two other screws appear to be 3/32".
The lanyard is about between 19/34 and 5/16.

The lanyard is 7.6mm. The pivot looks to be about 3.65mm.
The front and mid screws are about 3.0mm.
