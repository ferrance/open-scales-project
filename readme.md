Open Scales Project

## Goals

I started playing around with CNC machining because I'm a lefty and
a knife guy. At some point I picked up a left handed spyderco PM2. 
It was great that they made one. But it only came in one handle 
and one steel, while the right hand version has dozens or possibly
even hundreds of variations.
