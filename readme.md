# Open Scales Project

## Goals

I started playing around with CNC machining because I'm a lefty and
a knife guy. At some point I picked up a left handed spyderco PM2. 
It was great that they made one. But it only came in one handle 
and one steel, while the right hand version has dozens or possibly
even hundreds of variations.

That knife started me down the CNC rabbit hole. I buit several 
machines until I had one that was accurate enough to make scales.
Now I spend my weekends making new scales, typically lefty 
friendly, for various knives. The results are here.

## Fininshed Knives

These are scales that you should be able to get working
