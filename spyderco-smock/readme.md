# Spyderco Smock

The scale is 2.5mm thick. If you go thinner you won't be able to fully tighten the pivot.

The counterbores should be 1.4mm deep. Should bevel edge (1mm at 90deg) and button hole (.5mm at 90 deprees).

The pivot hole has been tight on a few of the scales I have cut. If you need to widen it you can
use a 3/16" drill. (The pivot is 4.5mm in diameter) 
If you need to expand the other two scale screws you can use a #30 or a 3.5mm.

The factory lock side scale has some minimal internal milling. I'm not using the spring detent so I
have omitted it. Similarly, the cutout for the lockbar does not seem to be necessary, so I have also
omitted that. I did need the relief for the pin that looks like a stop pin but isn't. 
To get that right I make a simple fixture with a 2mm deep cutout for the scale and a drill (using
the same 2mm mill that I use for everything else) at the middle of the relief. This lets me 
align by putting the mill in the drilled spot, then put the scale in the fixtere and mill out
the hole (to .5mm).
