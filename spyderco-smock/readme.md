# Spyderco Smock

![Spyderco Smock](/spyderco-smock/images/smock.jpg)The scale is 2.5mm thick. If you go thinner you won't be able to fully tighten the pivot.
The smock isn't a good fit for 2d milling because it has contoured cutouts for 
thumb access to the spydie hole. However, I've found that not having these cutouts isn't
a big deal for me in actual practice. 

The factory scales are 2.5mm thick.
The counterbores should be 1.5mm deep, although I've been milling them at 1.4 because
if the scale is a little thin then it is possible to fully tighten the pivot and still 
have space between the pivot screws and the scales, which creates side to side play. 

I bevel the edge (1mm at 90deg) and the button hole (.5mm at 90 deprees).

The pivot hole has been tight on a few of the scales I have cut. If you need to widen it you can
use a 4.5mm drill.   If you need to expand the other two scale screws you can use a 3.5mm drill.

The factory lock side scale has some minimal internal milling. I'm not using the spring detent so I
have omitted it. Similarly, the cutout for the lockbar does not seem to be necessary, so I have also
omitted that. I did need the relief for the pin that looks like a stop pin but isn't. 
To get that right I make a simple fixture with a 2mm deep cutout for the scale and a drill (using
the same 2mm mill that I use for everything else) at the middle of the relief. This lets me 
align by putting the mill in the drilled spot, then put the scale in the fixtere and mill out
the hole (to .5mm).
