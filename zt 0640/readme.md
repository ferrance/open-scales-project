# Zero Tolerance 0640

## Original Knife

The 0640 uses 2mm thick green carbon fiber scales (there was a limited edition in black). The lock
side has two cutouts on the back; the non-lock side is simple and has no cutouts. 

## The scales

Given the simplicity of this scale, I've chosen to render it as an SVG. 

For either side, I start with a 1.5x6" piece that is about 1/8" thick, then
sand it down to a 2mm thickness.

### The non-locking side

The non-locking side requires only a few holes and a bevel. This can 
be machined with two tools. I have used a 2mm end mill for everything except
the final bevel. The final bevel uses a 120 degree chamfer mill.

ESTLcam does the bevel after it cuts out the part, so you need to make sure
that the piece is adhered to the spoilboard.
