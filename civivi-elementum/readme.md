# Civivi Elementum

![spyderco manix 2](images/manix-in-progress.jpg)

The elementum is a fairly simple scale design. It's linerless 
and smaller than the liners. The scales (at least on mine)
are 2.1mm thick.

The lock side scale has a little milling to allow the liner 
lock to move when the blade is closed.

The non-locking side has a notch in the pivot that serves 
much the same function as a D-slot would in other knives.

## Setup

This is a one-sided scale. I prep this with blue painters
tape on one side, then use superglue to secure it 
to some waste board of the same width as the scale but a little taller.

Because this scale barely fits in the 1.5" stock I am using, it needs to be lined
up exactly. Put a bit in and lower it below the stock near the
bottom left edge. Position the stock so it touches the bit and 
lightly secure the left edge. Then move the bit to the 
bottom right. Push the right edge down until it is touching the
bit and lightly secure. Go back and forth a few times to make
sure that the piece is closely alined with your X axis.

At this point I use the planer at 2.6mm, 140x42 to get the 
material to the correct height.

Now raise the bit to about the level of the piece. Position it
so that its center is on the lower edge. It should be about a
centimeter right of your left clamp. This will be the home
position for all of the passes.

## Making the cuts

If you have a piece of stock that is the correct thickness, this
scale is very easy to cut, requiring only one tool change.

I use a 2mm endmill for everything other than the chamfers. 
Basically I just have that tool cut all the holes and the part.
The rest is done with a 6mm, 90 degree chamfer bit. The 
pivot is chamfered to 1.7mm. The other two chamfered screw
holes go to 1.3mm. The part is chamfered to 1mm. And I 
like to chamfer the lock mechanism to .5mm.
That's it!
