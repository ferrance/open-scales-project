# Civivi Elementum

![spyderco manix 2](images/manix-in-progress.jpg)

The elementum is a fairly simple scale design. It is a liner lock
and smaller than the liners. The scales (at least on mine)
are a tiny bit over 2mm thick.

The lock side scale has a little milling to allow the liner 
lock to move when the blade is closed.

The non-locking side has a notch in the pivot that serves 
much the same function as a D-slot would in other knives.

The edges appear to be chamfered. I'm doing a 1mm chamfer with a 
90 degree bit.

## Setup

The non-locking side is one-sided and the lock side is milled on both sides. 
I prep this with blue painters tape on one side, then use superglue to secure it 
to some waste board of the same width as the scale but a little taller. For the 
two-sided one, I put the tape and glue on after cutting the first side.

I was able to find 2mm stock (copper!), so I did not 
At this point I use the planer at 2.6mm, 140x42 to get the 
material to the correct height.

## Making the cuts

If you have a piece of stock that is the correct thickness, this
scale is very easy to cut, requiring only one tool change.

I use a 2mm endmill for everything other than the chamfers. 
Basically I just have that tool cut all the holes and the part.
The rest is done with a 6mm, 90 degree chamfer bit. The 
pivot is chamfered to 1.7mm. The other two chamfered screw
holes go to 1.3mm. The part is chamfered to 1mm. And I 
like to chamfer the lock mechanism to .5mm.
That's it!
