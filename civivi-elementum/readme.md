# Civivi Elementum

![spyderco manix 2](images/manix-in-progress.jpg)

The elementum is a fairly simple scale design. It is a liner lock
and smaller than the liners. The scales (at least on mine)
are a tiny bit over 2mm thick.

The lock side scale has a little milling to allow the liner 
lock to move when the blade is closed.

The non-locking side has a notch in the pivot that serves 
much the same function as a D-slot would in other knives.

The edges appear to be chamfered. I'm doing a 1mm chamfer with a 
90 degree bit.

## Setup

The non-locking side is one-sided and the lock side is milled on both sides. 
I prep this with blue painters tape on one side, then use superglue to secure it 
to some waste board of the same width as the scale but a little taller. For the 
two-sided one, I put the tape and glue on after cutting the first side.

I was able to find 2mm stock (copper!), so I did not 
At this point I use the planer at 2.6mm, 140x42 to get the 
material to the correct height.

## Making the cuts

If you have a piece of stock that is the correct thickness, this
scale is very easy to cut, requiring only one tool change.

I use a 2mm endmill for everything other than the chamfers. 
Basically I just have that tool cut all the holes and the part.
The rest is done with a 6mm, 90 degree chamfer bit. The 
pivot is chamfered to 1.7mm. The other two chamfered screw
holes go to 1.3mm. The part is chamfered to 1mm. And I 
like to chamfer the lock mechanism to .5mm.
That's it!

Lock side. Set the zero on the left alignment hole.
Cut the inside, which is the two holes and the liner
lock relief cutout.
Remove piece and tape the side you just cut. Verify that
your 1/8" rods fit all the holes. Apply superglue and place
the piece, using the two holes to get the alignment right.
Remove the rod from the right side since that's where
you will need to probe for the Z axis. Now you can
run the outside cut.

Non-lock side. This side is much easier. Simply tape and
glue the piece. Cut the holes, then pause and use some
screws to secure the piece. Then cut the outline.

## Misc notes

To make this knife left hand friendly, I needed to mill these scales 
out of metal and drill and tap the two holes for the clip.
The clip screws are M2.5. This means use of a 2.05mm drill.

Will a 2.0mm hole work? It works just fine.

Make holes
 deeper in copper based on how my probe 
is working. 1.5mm for the insets and 2.5 for the thru holes.

No problems with .1mm doc, 10mm/s, 9krpm on the 2mm 3-flute.
